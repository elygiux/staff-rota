2. Swicht to project directory.
3. Run in your terminal:  ``` composer install ```

5. Run the migrations and seed the table:
``` php artisan migrate ``` and ``` php artisan db:seed ```
6. Run: ``` npm install ``` and wait few minutes for it to install.

 #### Some explanations
 
 1. In Staff shift times table days are translated to human readable. Assumed day 0 is sunday.
 2. If some case 'daynumber' is not representing a day of week, days are displayed as numbers in pie charts.
 3. Highcharts is required in bower, but not used. Links from CDN's used for better performance. Could be done the same
 with bootstrap and jquery.
 4. The task is done how I understood it. It is quite confusing.
